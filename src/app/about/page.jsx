                <p style={{ maxWidth: "600px" }}>
                  With the help of the social workerâ€™s counseling and the power
                  of their faith, the children are able to overcome their past

                  Upendo is all about spreading love and making a difference in
                  the lives of children in need. Through its sponsorship
                  program, weâ€™re are able to support at least 50 more children
                  who may not live at the home, but still benefit from our
                  resources. Not only does this help there children succeed in
                  their education, it also takes a weight off the shoulders of
                  their families, who can focus on other priorities.
